Image restoration refers to the process of improving the quality of a digital image by removing or reducing various types of degradations, such as noise, blurring, compression artifacts, or other imperfections
GFPGAN (Generative Face Parsing with Graph Convolutional Networks) is a deep learning-based method that focuses on generating high-quality face parsing results from an input image. 
Face parsing involves segmenting a facial image into different semantic regions, such as hair, eyes, nose, and mouth. 
GFPGAN leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture both local and global context information, enhancing the accuracy of the face parsing results.
The processing steps for image restoration as follows:
step1:- Clone the repository in colab
step2:- Unzip the file
Step3:- use ipynb file to perform image restoration
